Writing redundant code sections is in-efficient and leads to problems when updating, since it is likely that one or more occurances may be overlooked.\n",

    "To prevent this kind of problem from occuring `functions` are used when writing code sections that need to be called on multiple occasions. Another reason `functions` are used is that they work as a separator for functionalities of the code.<br> This explanation seems obvious, but it is important when thinking about the naming of `functions`.\n",
