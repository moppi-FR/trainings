    "# User Interfaces & Multi-Threading\n",
    "User Interfaces (UI) are an important aspect of a software's acceptance. The more intuitive an interface is, the higher the acceptance and the better the user experience. There are multiple different UI libraries for Python in existance. During this course the `tkinter` library will be used to create a User Interface that lets the user create instances of the `Material` class from the previous course, add them to a list and display them in the UI. To achieve this, the `Material` class must first be saved as a single python module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this course deals with multi-threading. Normally when a module is run, it executes from top to bottom in a single thread. This means, that all processes are sequential and the is no parallel processing. This means that continuous processes potentially block the code from executing indefinitely. Multi-threading enables parallel tasks to be run."
